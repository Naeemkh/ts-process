# tsprocess

Ground motion time series processing tools

This is a collection of Python3-based software programs that are ground motions time series processing utilities designed to integrate 3D ground motion simulation seismograms from AWP-ODC and Hercules with Broadband Platform time series. The tsprocess library also provides codes for calculating ROTD50 so that a common implementation is used to process both 3D simulation seismograms and 1D broadband platform seismograms.

These codes have been developed as part of earthquake ground motion research performed by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) www.scec.org.
