About
======
This is a collection of Python3-based software programs that are ground motions time series processing utilities designed to integrate 3D ground motion simulation seismograms from AWP-ODC and Hercules with Broadband Platform time series. The ts-process library also provides codes for calculating ROTD50 so that a common implementation is used to process both 3D simulation seismograms and 1D broadband platform seismograms.
